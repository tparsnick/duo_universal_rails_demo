# Overview

A minimal demo rails app using the duo_universal_ruby 2FA API to Duo's WebSDK apps with universal prompt.
The rails app has a login workflow and utilizes the failmode flag for bypassing DUO when there is a duo health_check fail.

## PreRequisites
- Have access to Duo Admin account
- Add a `Web SDK` application, which will be enabled with the universal prompt by default
- [Enable user access to the app](https://duo.com/docs/protecting-applications#user-access)
- add a user through the Duo Admin interface.

## Puma server configured for HTTPS using an auto-generated Self-Signed SSL
Puma automatically generates self-signed SSL certificates at runtime, mimicking the `ssl_context='adhoc'` feature from Python's Flask.

1. Health Check  
Your application sends a health check to Duoâ€™s service to verify connectivity.

2. Authorization Request (OAuth/OIDC)  
The application constructs a JWT containing a `redirect_uri` and sends an authorization request to Duoâ€™s authorization endpoint.

3. Duo Universal Prompt (Hosted by Duo)  
Duo presents the two-factor authentication prompt on its hosted UI (push, passkeys, etc.).

4. Successful 2FA â†’ Redirect  
Upon successful verification, Duo redirects the userâ€™s browser back to the provided `redirect_uri`.

5. Retrieve Authentication Result (Token Exchange)  
Your application exchanges the authorization code at Duoâ€™s Access Token endpoint to retrieve the authentication result, including contextual information about the 2FA event.


### Notes

- The `redirect_uri` must match between the authorization request and the appâ€™s endpoint handling the authentication result.
- Duoâ€™s flow is a tailored OAuth/OIDC Authorization Code Flow.
- Embedding Duoâ€™s universal prompt in an iframe is disallowed; the prompt must be presented as a full-page redirect.
